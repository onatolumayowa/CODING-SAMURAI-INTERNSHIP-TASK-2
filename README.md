# Employee Demographics and Department Insights

### Project Overview

This project delivers a dynamic Employee Demographics and Department Insights Dashboard built from a synthetic dataset containing 10,000 employee records. The dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of the organization’s workforce, segmented by department, gender, age, education level, years of service, and salary ranges.

Designed for HR teams, executives, and business leaders, the dashboard enables quick exploration of workforce composition, diversity metrics, and salary patterns empowering stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions on recruitment, retention, and strategic workforce planning.


### Data Source


### Tools

- Excel


### Tasks

1. Analyze the distribution of employees across departments.

2. Visualize the gender split and age distribution using pie
charts and histograms.

3. Identify the average salary by department.


### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Checked for duplicates
  
- Removed unused columns

- Used IFs function to group the 'Age' column


### Analysis

**1**. Analyze the distribution of employees across departments


**Employee Count by Department — Percentage Analysis**



|Department|Employees|% of Total Workforce|
|----------|---------|--------------------|
|R&D|1053|10.53%|
|Marketing|1045|10.45%|
|Sales|1036|10.36%|
|IT|1034|10.34%|
|Operations|996|9.96%|
|HR|993|9.93%|
|Finance|984|9.84%|
|Logistics|959|9.59%|
|Customer Service|951|9.51%|
|Legal|949|9.49%|


**Key Observations**


- Top Departments:

   - R&D leads with the highest count (~1,060 employees), followed closely by Marketing (~1,050) and Sales (~1,040).

   - This reflects a strategic emphasis on innovation, brand growth, and revenue generation.


- Mid-range Staffing:

   - IT (~1,035) and Operations (~1,000) have substantial employee bases, supporting technology infrastructure and internal processes.


- Smaller Departments:

   - HR (~995) and Finance (~990) operate with leaner teams.

   - Logistics, Customer Service, and Legal have the fewest employees (<960), suggesting streamlined support functions.

 
- Workforce Distribution Pattern:

   - The company’s workforce is heavily concentrated in product development (R&D), market expansion (Marketing & Sales), and tech/operations, with relatively fewer employees      in administrative and support roles.


- Possible Interpretation:

   - The staffing pattern indicates a growth-focused organizational strategy, with major resources allocated to product development, market expansion, and operational             support, while maintaining efficiency in administrative and service roles.
 

**2**. Visualize the gender split using pie charts


**Gender Distribution**


| Gender       | Percentage |
|--------------|------------|
| Female       | 33.6%      |
| Male         | 33.5%      |
| Non-binary   | 33.0%      |



**Observations**


- Nearly Equal Representation:


   - The percentages are almost evenly split among all three gender categories, each hovering around one-third of the workforce.

   - The largest group, Female, exceeds the smallest group, Non-binary, by only 0.6 percentage points.


- Balanced Workforce:


   - Such minimal gaps suggest that the organization has achieved a remarkably balanced gender representation, which is rare in many industries.


- Diversity Implications:


   - This balance may reflect inclusive recruitment policies and a workplace culture that supports diversity across all gender identities.

   - It also minimizes the risk of decision-making biases that can stem from demographic imbalances.

 

**3**. Visualize age distribution using pie chart


**Age Distribution Data**


|Age Group|Percentage|
|---------|----------|
|45+|44.59%|
|31-45|34.20%|
|21-30|21.21%|
